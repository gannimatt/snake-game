# Snake Game Application Development

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Snake Game Application with a modern Graphical User Interface (GUI), robust game logic, and comprehensive automated testing. Our goal is to provide an immersive and visually appealing gaming experience, ensuring reliability and usability across various platforms and devices.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Develop Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Snake Game Application

**Description**: Design and implement the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Snake game application, providing players with an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

**Specific Requirements**:
- Design a user-friendly interface including the game board, snake, food, and score display.
- Use appropriate libraries/frameworks like Tkinter, Pygame, or PyQt for GUI components.
- Integrate interactive elements for game control (start/restart, pause/resume) and settings adjustment.
- Follow responsive design principles for compatibility with different screen sizes.
- Enhance user experience with visual feedback for game activities.

**Expected Outcome**:
- A fully functional and engaging GUI that effectively communicates game status and facilitates user interactions.
